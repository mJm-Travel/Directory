Dimitris was early to pick us up and whisk us away for a great day.  He got us to the Acropolis before all the crowds, so we could take in the beauty and splendor of everything there.  We then went to Temple of Zues.  We then went up to Mount Lycabettus for amazing views and history.  The next stop was at the Ancient Agora and then to see the changing of the guards at the Presidential Palace.  On a Sunday, the guards wear a formal dress uniform and Dimitris explained each detail of the uniform.  We Decided to not do the Acropolis Museum and went the next day to have more time to truly enjoy it, but Dimitris also shared great tips, including starting on the 3rd floor.\n\nLunch was included and was great.  Dimitris was ready to pick us up when we were done, didn&#39;t have to rush, but didn&#39;t have to spend more time at lunch than needed!\n\nWOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND!\n\nAN amazing day.  Dimitris was a wonderful host and made many stops along the way to share more about Greek history.

He is a proud Athenian that truly loves his country, town and the rich history that comes with it. He meticulously explained everything we were doing beforehand. He gave us easy to understand instructions at every stop. He was so warm and welcoming. Andreas gave us the experience of a lifetime!! So many personal touches. The first stop was atop the highest peak in the city. This was not planned, but Andreas was so dynamic and flexible. He gave us local treats (bougatsa) and took us by a local eatery. We even drove by his home. We can tell that he just wanted us to be happy greeting us every time we came back to our transport. He even gave us tips for other excursion experiences and dinner places! Andreas is unforgettable! It almost felt like he had the key to the city. If you want an uncharted and real experience in Athens, Greece you better figure out how to schedule a one on one tour with Andreas! It is world class VIP tour at its finest!","userId":967250950,"reviewId":967250950,"username":"Walter_B","uploadedDate":"2024-08-28","helpfulVotes":0,"rating":5,"isTaMedia":false}},{"fullSizeImage":{"elementType":"img","src":"https://media.tacdn.com/media/photo-w/2d/22/18/a2/caption.jpg","srcSet":"https://media.tacdn.com/media/photo-w/2d/22/18/a2/caption.jpg 674w","sizes":"(min-width:1024px) 674px,(min-width:768px and max-width:1023px) 674px,(max-width:767px) 100vw","alt":"","isEnhanced":false},"thumbnailImage":{"elementType":"img","src":"https://media.tacdn.com/media/photo-l/2d/22/18/a2/caption.jpg","srcSet":"https://media.tacdn.com/media/photo-l/2d/22/18/a2/caption.jpg 360w","sizes":"(min-width:1024px) 674px,(min-width:768px and max-width:1023px) 674px,(max-width:767px) 100vw","alt":"","isEnhanced":false},"source":"TRAVELLER","index":74,"associatedReview":{"title":"Amazing experience","text":"The view of the city was amazing.

Why yes, yes we did!\n\nStefanos was AMAZING. The passion, love, and excitement for his Greek culture, and his city came out of every pore of his being. He was knowledgeable, and enthusiastic about everything he told us, it was easy to be caught up in the magic of it all.\n\nWe were picked up at the cruise port, and ushered to a new, clean and AIR CONDITIONED car, where we had the opportunity to chat. He shared the plans for the day, and off we went. He was a wonderful narrator during the drive, being sure to point out interesting things, and sharing stories. He matched our &#34;energy&#34; just right, so he knew exactly how to communicate with us!\n\nAll of our site admissions were planned and timed with accuracy, and he knew exactly where to drop us for the most convenient experience and access. Before we would go to a site, he shared pictures, and history, to help improve our time exploring each archeological place. We appreciated not having to go with a group, and we were able to experience each place at our own pace and leisure. We&#39;d set a time to return to the car, and he&#39;d have it running, cold, and ready to go (with a bottle of water).\n\nThe lunch was very good (my adult son said it was one of his favorites of the whole trip), and included a salad, a gyro, drink of your choice (soda, wine or beer) and dessert.\n\nWe hit all of the sites advertised with the tour package, and used every minute of our anticipated 8 hours. You&#39;d think that it would be too long, but it was perfect. We never felt rushed, bored or ready to &#39;be done&#39; and almost felt sad it had to end.\n\nWhen I was booking originally, I thought this was a big financial splurge, but it was worth every penny and definitely a good investment (especially after hearing stories from other families on the cruise that had less then ideal experiences). I would highly recommend this tour to anyone who is considering a wonderful experience and opportunity to see as much of Athens in one day as possible. This is the way to go.

Good thing we started early because the crowd at the Acropolis was really starting to build up. When we were done, Stefanos was right there again to meet us to take us to our next destination and also had a bottle of cold water handy knowing it was hot and we were walking around a lot. Then off to the Temple of Hephaestus and Temple of Zeus before going to lunch. We spent some time at the Acropolis museum before Stefanos was nice enough to drop us back off at our AirBnb to get refreshed. When we met up again, we had a long scenic trip to have dinner by the water followed by the most beautiful sunset at the Temple of Poseidon. You can tell Stefanos was a proud born and raised Athenian through his passion for Greek culture and history, which we very much appreciated. It was about 10:00pm by the time we were dropped back off at our AirBnb and all of us were exhausted from all the activities during the day but not Stefanos - he kept up his positive energy throughout the entire day.

We searched full day private tours and thought this one fit our desires.  We wanted to be picked up at our  hotel early in the morning.  We were provided with the name and contact information of ou guide after we booked the tour. The tour guide, Dimitri, met us promptly at 8am in front of the hotel with a friendly smile. We boarded a nice SUV and he took us to the Acropolis for our first stop. He gave us the history of the Parthenon and temples before he directed us up the road with our tickets to help us bypass the crowd. He gave us just the right amount of time to see everything. \nWe then toured the Agora with prepaid tickets with sufficient time to see most of the area. \nThere was a good mixture of the ancient sites and the more modern parts of Athens.\nDimitri was very friendly,  courteous and considerate of our time and preferences. It was a warm day so he provided us with cold water several times during our tour. He shared so much history and information about everything we saw. The Olympic stadium was extremely enjoyable due to Dimitri&#39;s comments. \nHe took us to the prime minister&#39;s and president&#39;s homes and gave us time to watch the changing of the guards. He explained  the uniforms and the significance and meaning of each part. He took our picture with one of the guards which was really special. \nWe had our included authentic Greek lunch at a quaint restaurant  with outside seating. It was delicious food and wonderful atmosphere. \nWe spent time at the beach at a seaside restaurant where we ordered beverages and   enjoyed the sea breezes. \nWe wanted to take home some souvenirs so Dimitri look us to a shop which turned out to have a lot of items with Greek significance. We then drove back to our hotel after Dimitri generously extended our tour to make sure we experienced everything we wanted to see and do.\nWe&#39;ve enjoyed other Viator tours, but this one was the best!!","title":"All of Athens in a Day","publishedAt":"2025-08-01T15:33:24","provider":"VIATOR","isMachineTranslated":false,"isMachineTranslationAvailable":false,"helpfulVotes":0,"isHelpful":false,"media":[],"tripadvisorLocationId":13330909,"isProvidedByTripadvisor":false},{"reviewId":1021890484,"user":{"userId":1021890484,"nickName":"Frances_M"},"rating":5,"text":"The day was well organized, with the Acropolis and Agora first thing in the morning and city tour and museum time later in the day.

From the moment he picked us up at our hotel at 9 a.m. in his comfortable, air-conditioned Hyundai van, we knew we were in for a special day.\n​Andreas is a true local with an incredible depth of knowledge and a genuine passion for his city. He&#39;s not just a driver; he&#39;s a fantastic guide who brings history to life. Because private guides aren&#39;t allowed inside the main sites, Andreas gave us a brilliant &#34;pre-intro&#34; to the Acropolis and the Ancient Agora before we went in. He used his tablet and picture books to explain the history and key points, which was so valuable and helped us appreciate everything we were seeing on our own. We spent about 1.5 hours exploring each site, and it was the perfect amount of time.\n​He then took us to see the fascinating changing of the Presidential Guard, a must-see! It was amazing to watch this 15-minute ceremony that happens every hour, all day, every day. As we drove around the city, he pointed out many other historical highlights, including the Olympic Stadium, and took us to the highest point for a breathtaking panoramic photo opportunity.\n​Lunch was a highlight! Andreas took us to his favorite restaurant, Proedros, where we had a delicious traditional Greek lunch that included a Greek salad, gyros, local beer, and a baklava dessert. It was the perfect midday break.\n​Throughout the day, Andreas was incredibly flexible and happy to adjust the schedule to suit us. He gave us extra time where we wanted it and even made a short stop for us to buy some gifts at the end. We couldn&#39;t help but make a personal connection with him; he is kind, knowledgeable, and full of heart. If you want an authentic, insightful, and truly personal tour of Athens, look no further than Andreas. We can&#39;t recommend him highly enough!","title":"A Perfect Day in Athens with Andreas","publishedAt":"2025-08-16T15:25:42","provider":"VIATOR","isMachineTranslated":false,"isMachineTranslationAvailable":false,"helpfulVotes":0,"isHelpful":false,"media":[],"tripadvisorLocationId":13330909,"isProvidedByTripadvisor":false},{"reviewId":1024667220,"user":{"userId":1024667220,"nickName":"Amy_N"},"rating":5,"text":"Great day!

Much of it was time spent walking the major sites on our own. We saw everything promised on the itinerary, but it was difficult to clearly see the drive-by locations from the rear seats of the tour van. The seating gets higher each row back, which makes looking out of the side windows difficult if you are a taller person. Our driver was pleasant and handled the driving duties perfectly, however he did have a thicker accent which made his English hard to understand through a low-volume microphone and the loud air conditioner noise in the rear of the van. For the price, I expected a lot more history and descriptions of our historical stops. The included lunch was very good in a nice restaurant. We took a second van trip the next day to the The Temple of Poseidon. Our guide with that company had a history degree and gave us so much more information and a better experience with her knowledge. That said, It is a convenient way to see the major sites of Athens in a single day, but the knowledge of the guide has a huge impact on the experience.","title":"A lot packed into a day.

We searched full day private tours and thought this one fit our desires.  We wanted to be picked up at our  hotel early in the morning.  We were provided with the name and contact information of ou guide after we booked the tour. The tour guide, Dimitri, met us promptly at 8am in front of the hotel with a friendly smile. We boarded a nice SUV and he took us to the Acropolis for our first stop. He gave us the history of the Parthenon and temples before he directed us up the road with our tickets to help us bypass the crowd. He gave us just the right amount of time to see everything. \nWe then toured the Agora with prepaid tickets with sufficient time to see most of the area. \nThere was a good mixture of the ancient sites and the more modern parts of Athens.\nDimitri was very friendly,  courteous and considerate of our time and preferences. It was a warm day so he provided us with cold water several times during our tour. He shared so much history and information about everything we saw. The Olympic stadium was extremely enjoyable due to Dimitri&#39;s comments. \nHe took us to the prime minister&#39;s and president&#39;s homes and gave us time to watch the changing of the guards. He explained  the uniforms and the significance and meaning of each part. He took our picture with one of the guards which was really special. \nWe had our included authentic Greek lunch at a quaint restaurant  with outside seating. It was delicious food and wonderful atmosphere. \nWe spent time at the beach at a seaside restaurant where we ordered beverages and   enjoyed the sea breezes. \nWe wanted to take home some souvenirs so Dimitri look us to a shop which turned out to have a lot of items with Greek significance. We then drove back to our hotel after Dimitri generously extended our tour to make sure we experienced everything we wanted to see and do.\nWe&#39;ve enjoyed other Viator tours, but this one was the best!!","datePublished":"2025-08-01","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":5,"ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Cheryl_M"}},{"@type":"Review","reviewBody":"The day was well organized, with the Acropolis and Agora first thing in the morning and city tour and museum time later in the day.

From the moment he picked us up at our hotel at 9 a.m. in his comfortable, air-conditioned Hyundai van, we knew we were in for a special day.\n​Andreas is a true local with an incredible depth of knowledge and a genuine passion for his city. He&#39;s not just a driver; he&#39;s a fantastic guide who brings history to life. Because private guides aren&#39;t allowed inside the main sites, Andreas gave us a brilliant &#34;pre-intro&#34; to the Acropolis and the Ancient Agora before we went in. He used his tablet and picture books to explain the history and key points, which was so valuable and helped us appreciate everything we were seeing on our own. We spent about 1.5 hours exploring each site, and it was the perfect amount of time.\n​He then took us to see the fascinating changing of the Presidential Guard, a must-see! It was amazing to watch this 15-minute ceremony that happens every hour, all day, every day. As we drove around the city, he pointed out many other historical highlights, including the Olympic Stadium, and took us to the highest point for a breathtaking panoramic photo opportunity.\n​Lunch was a highlight! Andreas took us to his favorite restaurant, Proedros, where we had a delicious traditional Greek lunch that included a Greek salad, gyros, local beer, and a baklava dessert. It was the perfect midday break.\n​Throughout the day, Andreas was incredibly flexible and happy to adjust the schedule to suit us. He gave us extra time where we wanted it and even made a short stop for us to buy some gifts at the end. We couldn&#39;t help but make a personal connection with him; he is kind, knowledgeable, and full of heart. If you want an authentic, insightful, and truly personal tour of Athens, look no further than Andreas. We can&#39;t recommend him highly enough!","datePublished":"2025-08-16","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":5,"ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Scott_F"}},{"@type":"Review","reviewBody":"Great day!

Much of it was time spent walking the major sites on our own. We saw everything promised on the itinerary, but it was difficult to clearly see the drive-by locations from the rear seats of the tour van. The seating gets higher each row back, which makes looking out of the side windows difficult if you are a taller person. Our driver was pleasant and handled the driving duties perfectly, however he did have a thicker accent which made his English hard to understand through a low-volume microphone and the loud air conditioner noise in the rear of the van. For the price, I expected a lot more history and descriptions of our historical stops. The included lunch was very good in a nice restaurant. We took a second van trip the next day to the The Temple of Poseidon. Our guide with that company had a history degree and gave us so much more information and a better experience with her knowledge. That said, It is a convenient way to see the major sites of Athens in a single day, but the knowledge of the guide has a huge impact on the experience.","datePublished":"2025-08-15","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":5,"ratingValue":4},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Loren_H"}},{"@type":"Review","reviewBody":"Cannot recommend Panos more.

He was very knowledgeable and gave us so much information about the areas we visited. He was prompt and courteous. The only downside of the tour was the lunch at a small restaurant. As we were a tour group of only five people they ignored us. We had to ask for drinks we had to ask for the lunch that we had ordered at least 35 minutes prior.
Other than the luncheon experience, everything else was amazing. We truly enjoyed our guide and would highly recommend this again with the exception of the lunch.</span></div></div><div class="container__b9es"><div class="container__HTBo"><div><!--$--><div

From the moment he picked us up at our hotel at 9 a.m. in his comfortable, air-conditioned Hyundai van, we knew we were in for a special day.
​Andreas is a true local with an incredible depth of knowledge and a genuine passion for his city. He&#x27;s not just a driver; he&#x27;s a fantastic guide who brings history to life. Because private guides aren&#x27;t allowed inside the main sites, Andreas gave us a brilliant &quot;pre-intro&quot; to the Acropolis and the Ancient Agora before we went in. He used his tablet and picture books to explain the history and key points, which was so valuable and helped us appreciate everything we were seeing on our own. We spent about 1.5 hours exploring each site, and it was the perfect amount of time.
​He then took us to see the fascinating changing of the Presidential Guard, a must-see! It was amazing to watch this 15-minute ceremony that happens every hour, all day, every day. As we drove around the city, he pointed out many other historical highlights, including the Olympic Stadium, and took us to the highest point for a breathtaking panoramic photo opportunity.
​Lunch was a highlight! Andreas took us to his favorite restaurant, Proedros, where we had a delicious traditional Greek lunch that included a Greek salad, gyros, local beer, and a baklava dessert. It was the perfect midday break.
​Throughout the day, Andreas was incredibly flexible and happy to adjust the schedule to suit us. He gave us extra time where we wanted it and even made a short stop for us to buy some gifts at the end. We couldn&#x27;t help but make a personal connection with him; he is kind, knowledgeable, and full of heart. If you want an authentic, insightful, and truly personal tour of Athens, look no further than Andreas. We can&#x27;t recommend him highly enough!</span></div></div></div></div><div class="review__ZiMd"><div><div class="title__ZdWt"><div class="ratingInfo__w7Il"><div class="starRating__VZ9P" aria-label="Rated 5.0 out of 5" role="img"><div class="stars__shHz"><svg viewBox="0 0 15 15" fill="none" class="starIcon__oVLE md__BECl"><path clip-rule="evenodd" d="M7.5 0a.77.77 0 00-.701.456L5.087 4.083a.785.785 0 01-.588.448l-3.827.582a.828.828 0 00-.433 1.395L3.008 9.33c.185.192.269.46.225.724l-.654 3.987a.809.809 0 00.77.958.751.751 0 00.364-.096l3.423-1.882a.752.752 0 01.728 0l3.423 1.882a.75.75 0 00.363.096.809.809 0 00.771-.958l-.654-3.987a.841.841 0 01.225-.724l2.77-2.823a.828.828 0 00-.434-1.396l-3.827-.581a.785.785 0 01-.589-.448L8.201.456A.77.77 0 007.5 0z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 15 15" fill="none" class="starIcon__oVLE md__BECl"><path clip-rule="evenodd" d="M7.5 0a.77.77 0 00-.701.456L5.087 4.083a.785.785 0 01-.588.448l-3.827.582a.828.828 0 00-.433 1.395L3.008 9.33c.185.192.269.46.225.724l-.654 3.987a.809.809 0 00.77.958.751.751 0 00.364-.096l3.423-1.882a.752.752 0 01.728 0l3.423 1.882a.75.75 0 00.363.096.809.809 0 00.771-.958l-.654-3.987a.841.841 0 01.225-.724l2.77-2.823a.828.828 0 00-.434-1.396l-3.827-.581a.785.785 0 01-.589-.448L8.201.456A.77.77 0 007.5 0z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 15 15" fill="none" class="starIcon__oVLE md__BECl"><path clip-rule="evenodd" d="M7.5 0a.77.77 0 00-.701.456L5.087 4.083a.785.785 0 01-.588.448l-3.827.582a.828.828 0 00-.433 1.395L3.008 9.33c.185.192.269.46.225.724l-.654 3.987a.809.809 0 00.77.958.751.751 0 00.364-.096l3.423-1.882a.752.752 0 01.728 0l3.423 1.882a.75.75 0 00.363.096.809.809 0 00.771-.958l-.654-3.987a.841.841 0 01.225-.724l2.77-2.823a.828.828 0 00-.434-1.396l-3.827-.581a.785.785 0 01-.589-.448L8.201.456A.77.77 0 007.5 0z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 15 15" fill="none" class="starIcon__oVLE md__BECl"><path clip-rule="evenodd" d="M7.5 0a.77.77 0 00-.701.456L5.087 4.083a.785.785 0 01-.588.448l-3.827.582a.828.828 0 00-.433 1.395L3.008 9.33c.185.192.269.46.225.724l-.654 3.987a.809.809 0 00.77.958.751.751 0 00.364-.096l3.423-1.882a.752.752 0 01.728 0l3.423 1.882a.75.75 0 00.363.096.809.809 0 00.771-.958l-.654-3.987a.841.841 0 01.225-.724l2.77-2.823a.828.828 0 00-.434-1.396l-3.827-.581a.785.785 0 01-.589-.448L8.201.456A.77.77 0 007.5 0z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 15 15" fill="none" class="starIcon__oVLE md__BECl"><path clip-rule="evenodd" d="M7.5 0a.77.77 0 00-.701.456L5.087 4.083a.785.785 0 01-.588.448l-3.827.582a.828.828 0 00-.433 1.395L3.008 9.33c.185.192.269.46.225.724l-.654 3.987a.809.809 0 00.77.958.751.751 0 00.364-.096l3.423-1.882a.752.752 0 01.728 0l3.423 1.882a.75.75 0 00.363.096.809.809 0 00.771-.958l-.654-3.987a.841.841 0 01.225-.724l2.77-2.823a.828.828 0 00-.434-1.396l-3.827-.581a.785.785 0 01-.589-.448L8.201.456A.77.77 0 007.5 0z"></path></svg></div></div><div class="ratingTitle__GKq3"><span class="title_v2__Olve title6_v2__Q3R0" role="heading" aria-level="6">Great day!

Much of it was time spent walking the major sites on our own. We saw everything promised on the itinerary, but it was difficult to clearly see the drive-by locations from the rear seats of the tour van. The seating gets higher each row back, which makes looking out of the side windows difficult if you are a taller person. Our driver was pleasant and handled the driving duties perfectly, however he did have a thicker accent which made his English hard to understand through a low-volume microphone and the loud air conditioner noise in the rear of the van. For the price, I expected a lot more history and descriptions of our historical stops. The included lunch was very good in a nice restaurant. We took a second van trip the next day to the The Temple of Poseidon. Our guide with that company had a history degree and gave us so much more information and a better experience with her knowledge. That said, It is a convenient way to see the major sites of Athens in a single day, but the knowledge of the guide has a huge impact on the experience.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="review__ZiMd"><div><div class="title__ZdWt"><div class="ratingInfo__w7Il"><div class="starRating__VZ9P" aria-label="Rated 5.0 out of 5" role="img"><div class="stars__shHz"><svg viewBox="0 0 15 15" fill="none" class="starIcon__oVLE md__BECl"><path clip-rule="evenodd" d="M7.5 0a.77.77 0 00-.701.456L5.087 4.083a.785.785 0 01-.588.448l-3.827.582a.828.828 0 00-.433 1.395L3.008 9.33c.185.192.269.46.225.724l-.654 3.987a.809.809 0 00.77.958.751.751 0 00.364-.096l3.423-1.882a.752.752 0 01.728 0l3.423 1.882a.75.75 0 00.363.096.809.809 0 00.771-.958l-.654-3.987a.841.841 0 01.225-.724l2.77-2.823a.828.828 0 00-.434-1.396l-3.827-.581a.785.785 0 01-.589-.448L8.201.456A.77.77 0 007.5 0z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 15 15" fill="none" class="starIcon__oVLE md__BECl"><path clip-rule="evenodd" d="M7.5 0a.77.77 0 00-.701.456L5.087 4.083a.785.785 0 01-.588.448l-3.827.582a.828.828 0 00-.433 1.395L3.008 9.33c.185.192.269.46.225.724l-.654 3.987a.809.809 0 00.77.958.751.751 0 00.364-.096l3.423-1.882a.752.752 0 01.728 0l3.423 1.882a.75.75 0 00.363.096.809.809 0 00.771-.958l-.654-3.987a.841.841 0 01.225-.724l2.77-2.823a.828.828 0 00-.434-1.396l-3.827-.581a.785.785 0 01-.589-.448L8.201.456A.77.77 0 007.5 0z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 15 15" fill="none" class="starIcon__oVLE md__BECl"><path clip-rule="evenodd" d="M7.5 0a.77.77 0 00-.701.456L5.087 4.083a.785.785 0 01-.588.448l-3.827.582a.828.828 0 00-.433 1.395L3.008 9.33c.185.192.269.46.225.724l-.654 3.987a.809.809 0 00.77.958.751.751 0 00.364-.096l3.423-1.882a.752.752 0 01.728 0l3.423 1.882a.75.75 0 00.363.096.809.809 0 00.771-.958l-.654-3.987a.841.841 0 01.225-.724l2.77-2.823a.828.828 0 00-.434-1.396l-3.827-.581a.785.785 0 01-.589-.448L8.201.456A.77.77 0 007.5 0z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 15 15" fill="none" class="starIcon__oVLE md__BECl"><path clip-rule="evenodd" d="M7.5 0a.77.77 0 00-.701.456L5.087 4.083a.785.785 0 01-.588.448l-3.827.582a.828.828 0 00-.433 1.395L3.008 9.33c.185.192.269.46.225.724l-.654 3.987a.809.809 0 00.77.958.751.751 0 00.364-.096l3.423-1.882a.752.752 0 01.728 0l3.423 1.882a.75.75 0 00.363.096.809.809 0 00.771-.958l-.654-3.987a.841.841 0 01.225-.724l2.77-2.823a.828.828 0 00-.434-1.396l-3.827-.581a.785.785 0 01-.589-.448L8.201.456A.77.77 0 007.5 0z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 15 15" fill="none" class="starIcon__oVLE md__BECl"><path clip-rule="evenodd" d="M7.5 0a.77.77 0 00-.701.456L5.087 4.083a.785.785 0 01-.588.448l-3.827.582a.828.828 0 00-.433 1.395L3.008 9.33c.185.192.269.46.225.724l-.654 3.987a.809.809 0 00.77.958.751.751 0 00.364-.096l3.423-1.882a.752.752 0 01.728 0l3.423 1.882a.75.75 0 00.363.096.809.809 0 00.771-.958l-.654-3.987a.841.841 0 01.225-.724l2.77-2.823a.828.828 0 00-.434-1.396l-3.827-.581a.785.785 0 01-.589-.448L8.201.456A.77.77 0 007.5 0z"></path></svg></div></div><div class="ratingTitle__GKq3"><span class="title_v2__Olve title6_v2__Q3R0" role="heading" aria-level="6">Ask for Panos!</span></div></div><div class="reviewHelpfulContainer__OVvz"><!--$--><div class="helpful__DQYk"><button aria-label="Helpful" type="button" class="helpfulIcon__fYm7"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="icon__UJ21"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M7.57 7.38L5.93 10H3.47C2.73 10 2 10.57 2 11.4v7.2c0 .83.73 1.4 1.47 1.4h2.9a555 555 0 001.18.62c.5.24 1.05.37 1.61.37h9.35c1.18 0 2.2-.9 2.35-2.08l.98-6.5v-.01l.1-.63a2.39 2.39 0 00-2.28-2.74 534.7 534.7 0 00-5.62 0h-.24v-3.4c0-.05 0-.1-.02-.14 0-.07-.01-.1-.02-.13l-.02-.16a2.1 2.1 0 00-.67-1.24 2.42 2.42 0 00-2.8-.36c-.34.19-.63.47-.84.8L7.57 7.39zm4.47-2.34A.92.92 0 0011 4.9a.8.8 0 00-.3.28c-.06.12-.97 1.57-1.86 2.99l-1.22 1.95v8.84l.6.3c.29.15.61.22.94.22h9.34c.43 0 .82-.34.87-.76.04-.35.75-5.03 1-6.64l.08-.55a.89.89 0 00-.85-1.02H19.51a63.26 63.26 0 00-1 0 2134.67 2134.67 0 00-4.47 0h-1a.75.75 0 01-.74-.75V5.7l-.02-.13V5.5a2.86 2.86 0 00-.05-.2.64.64 0 00-.2-.27zM6.12 11.5v7H3.5v-7h2.62z"></path></svg></button></div><!--/$--></div></div><div class="subtitle__RTpH">Lisa_L, <!-- -->Aug 2025</div><div class="reviewTextColor__mGFi"><div><span style="word-wrap:break-word">Cannot recommend Panos more.

Also, having lunch planned into the day was helpful.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="review__ZiMd hiddenReview__gnEW"><div><div class="title__ZdWt"><div class="ratingInfo__w7Il"><div class="starRating__VZ9P" aria-label="Rated 5.0 out of 5" role="img"><div class="stars__shHz"><svg viewBox="0 0 15 15" fill="none" class="starIcon__oVLE md__BECl"><path clip-rule="evenodd" d="M7.5 0a.77.77 0 00-.701.456L5.087 4.083a.785.785 0 01-.588.448l-3.827.582a.828.828 0 00-.433 1.395L3.008 9.33c.185.192.269.46.225.724l-.654 3.987a.809.809 0 00.77.958.751.751 0 00.364-.096l3.423-1.882a.752.752 0 01.728 0l3.423 1.882a.75.75 0 00.363.096.809.809 0 00.771-.958l-.654-3.987a.841.841 0 01.225-.724l2.77-2.823a.828.828 0 00-.434-1.396l-3.827-.581a.785.785 0 01-.589-.448L8.201.456A.77.77 0 007.5 0z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 15 15" fill="none" class="starIcon__oVLE md__BECl"><path clip-rule="evenodd" d="M7.5 0a.77.77 0 00-.701.456L5.087 4.083a.785.785 0 01-.588.448l-3.827.582a.828.828 0 00-.433 1.395L3.008 9.33c.185.192.269.46.225.724l-.654 3.987a.809.809 0 00.77.958.751.751 0 00.364-.096l3.423-1.882a.752.752 0 01.728 0l3.423 1.882a.75.75 0 00.363.096.809.809 0 00.771-.958l-.654-3.987a.841.841 0 01.225-.724l2.77-2.823a.828.828 0 00-.434-1.396l-3.827-.581a.785.785 0 01-.589-.448L8.201.456A.77.77 0 007.5 0z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 15 15" fill="none" class="starIcon__oVLE md__BECl"><path clip-rule="evenodd" d="M7.5 0a.77.77 0 00-.701.456L5.087 4.083a.785.785 0 01-.588.448l-3.827.582a.828.828 0 00-.433 1.395L3.008 9.33c.185.192.269.46.225.724l-.654 3.987a.809.809 0 00.77.958.751.751 0 00.364-.096l3.423-1.882a.752.752 0 01.728 0l3.423 1.882a.75.75 0 00.363.096.809.809 0 00.771-.958l-.654-3.987a.841.841 0 01.225-.724l2.77-2.823a.828.828 0 00-.434-1.396l-3.827-.581a.785.785 0 01-.589-.448L8.201.456A.77.77 0 007.5 0z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 15 15" fill="none" class="starIcon__oVLE md__BECl"><path clip-rule="evenodd" d="M7.5 0a.77.77 0 00-.701.456L5.087 4.083a.785.785 0 01-.588.448l-3.827.582a.828.828 0 00-.433 1.395L3.008 9.33c.185.192.269.46.225.724l-.654 3.987a.809.809 0 00.77.958.751.751 0 00.364-.096l3.423-1.882a.752.752 0 01.728 0l3.423 1.882a.75.75 0 00.363.096.809.809 0 00.771-.958l-.654-3.987a.841.841 0 01.225-.724l2.77-2.823a.828.828 0 00-.434-1.396l-3.827-.581a.785.785 0 01-.589-.448L8.201.456A.77.77 0 007.5 0z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 15 15" fill="none" class="starIcon__oVLE md__BECl"><path clip-rule="evenodd" d="M7.5 0a.77.77 0 00-.701.456L5.087 4.083a.785.785 0 01-.588.448l-3.827.582a.828.828 0 00-.433 1.395L3.008 9.33c.185.192.269.46.225.724l-.654 3.987a.809.809 0 00.77.958.751.751 0 00.364-.096l3.423-1.882a.752.752 0 01.728 0l3.423 1.882a.75.75 0 00.363.096.809.809 0 00.771-.958l-.654-3.987a.841.841 0 01.225-.724l2.77-2.823a.828.828 0 00-.434-1.396l-3.827-.581a.785.785 0 01-.589-.448L8.201.456A.77.77 0 007.5 0z"></path></svg></div></div><div class="ratingTitle__GKq3"><span class="title_v2__Olve title6_v2__Q3R0" role="heading" aria-level="6">All of Athens in a Day</span></div></div><div class="reviewHelpfulContainer__OVvz"><!--$--><div class="helpful__DQYk"><button aria-label="Helpful" type="button" class="helpfulIcon__fYm7"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="icon__UJ21"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M7.57 7.38L5.93 10H3.47C2.73 10 2 10.57 2 11.4v7.2c0 .83.73 1.4 1.47 1.4h2.9a555 555 0 001.18.62c.5.24 1.05.37 1.61.37h9.35c1.18 0 2.2-.9 2.35-2.08l.98-6.5v-.01l.1-.63a2.39 2.39 0 00-2.28-2.74 534.7 534.7 0 00-5.62 0h-.24v-3.4c0-.05 0-.1-.02-.14 0-.07-.01-.1-.02-.13l-.02-.16a2.1 2.1 0 00-.67-1.24 2.42 2.42 0 00-2.8-.36c-.34.19-.63.47-.84.8L7.57 7.39zm4.47-2.34A.92.92 0 0011 4.9a.8.8 0 00-.3.28c-.06.12-.97 1.57-1.86 2.99l-1.22 1.95v8.84l.6.3c.29.15.61.22.94.22h9.34c.43 0 .82-.34.87-.76.04-.35.75-5.03 1-6.64l.08-.55a.89.89 0 00-.85-1.02H19.51a63.26 63.26 0 00-1 0 2134.67 2134.67 0 00-4.47 0h-1a.75.75 0 01-.74-.75V5.7l-.02-.13V5.5a2.86 2.86 0 00-.05-.2.64.64 0 00-.2-.27zM6.12 11.5v7H3.5v-7h2.62z"></path></svg></button></div><!--/$--></div></div><div class="subtitle__RTpH">Cheryl_M, <!-- -->Aug 2025</div><div class="reviewTextColor__mGFi"><div><span style="word-wrap:break-word">We had a party of 4-two couples-visiting Athens for the first time and wanted to see as much of the city as possible in one day. We searched full day private tours and thought this one fit our desires.  We wanted to be picked up at our  hotel early in the morning.  We were provided with the name and contact information of ou guide after we booked the tour. The tour guide, Dimitri, met us promptly at 8am in front of the hotel with a friendly smile. We boarded a nice SUV and he took us to the Acropolis for our first stop. He gave us the history of the Parthenon and temples before he directed us up the road with our tickets to help us bypass the crowd. He gave us just the right amount of time to see everything. 
We then toured the Agora with prepaid tickets with sufficient time to see most of the area. 
There was a good mixture of the ancient sites and the more modern parts of Athens.
Dimitri was very friendly,  courteous and considerate of our time and preferences. It was a warm day so he provided us with cold water several times during our tour. He shared so much history and information about everything we saw. The Olympic stadium was extremely enjoyable due to Dimitri&#x27;s comments. 
He took us to the prime minister&#x27;s and president&#x27;s homes and gave us time to watch the changing of the guards. He explained  the uniforms and the significance and meaning of each part. He took our picture with one of the guards which was really special. 
We had our included authentic Greek lunch at a quaint restaurant  with outside seating. It was delicious food and wonderful atmosphere. 
We spent time at the beach at a seaside restaurant where we ordered beverages and   enjoyed the sea breezes. 
We wanted to take home some souvenirs so Dimitri look us to a shop which turned out to have a lot of items with Greek significance. We then drove back to our hotel after Dimitri generously extended our tour to make sure we experienced everything we wanted to see and do.

Our kids absolutely loved the experience, as did we. We are very efficient, so it was nice to be able to go into the acropolis and the aggora on our own to move at our own pace, and have our tour guide just pick us up when we were done - we actually preferred that to having someone walk us around inside. Andreas was fun, funny, knowledgeable, and engaging with our 2 daughters!  We loved Athens, and this was a fantastic way to see highlights during a shorter stay. We will be back!!</span></div></div></div></div><div class="review__ZiMd hiddenReview__gnEW"><div><div class="title__ZdWt"><div class="ratingInfo__w7Il"><div class="starRating__VZ9P" aria-label="Rated 5.0 out of 5" role="img"><div class="stars__shHz"><svg viewBox="0 0 15 15" fill="none" class="starIcon__oVLE md__BECl"><path clip-rule="evenodd" d="M7.5 0a.77.77 0 00-.701.456L5.087 4.083a.785.785 0 01-.588.448l-3.827.582a.828.828 0 00-.433 1.395L3.008 9.33c.185.192.269.46.225.724l-.654 3.987a.809.809 0 00.77.958.751.751 0 00.364-.096l3.423-1.882a.752.752 0 01.728 0l3.423 1.882a.75.75 0 00.363.096.809.809 0 00.771-.958l-.654-3.987a.841.841 0 01.225-.724l2.77-2.823a.828.828 0 00-.434-1.396l-3.827-.581a.785.785 0 01-.589-.448L8.201.456A.77.77 0 007.5 0z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 15 15" fill="none" class="starIcon__oVLE md__BECl"><path clip-rule="evenodd" d="M7.5 0a.77.77 0 00-.701.456L5.087 4.083a.785.785 0 01-.588.448l-3.827.582a.828.828 0 00-.433 1.395L3.008 9.33c.185.192.269.46.225.724l-.654 3.987a.809.809 0 00.77.958.751.751 0 00.364-.096l3.423-1.882a.752.752 0 01.728 0l3.423 1.882a.75.75 0 00.363.096.809.809 0 00.771-.958l-.654-3.987a.841.841 0 01.225-.724l2.77-2.823a.828.828 0 00-.434-1.396l-3.827-.581a.785.785 0 01-.589-.448L8.201.456A.77.77 0 007.5 0z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 15 15" fill="none" class="starIcon__oVLE md__BECl"><path clip-rule="evenodd" d="M7.5 0a.77.77 0 00-.701.456L5.087 4.083a.785.785 0 01-.588.448l-3.827.582a.828.828 0 00-.433 1.395L3.008 9.33c.185.192.269.46.225.724l-.654 3.987a.809.809 0 00.77.958.751.751 0 00.364-.096l3.423-1.882a.752.752 0 01.728 0l3.423 1.882a.75.75 0 00.363.096.809.809 0 00.771-.958l-.654-3.987a.841.841 0 01.225-.724l2.77-2.823a.828.828 0 00-.434-1.396l-3.827-.581a.785.785 0 01-.589-.448L8.201.456A.77.77 0 007.5 0z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 15 15" fill="none" class="starIcon__oVLE md__BECl"><path clip-rule="evenodd" d="M7.5 0a.77.77 0 00-.701.456L5.087 4.083a.785.785 0 01-.588.448l-3.827.582a.828.828 0 00-.433 1.395L3.008 9.33c.185.192.269.46.225.724l-.654 3.987a.809.809 0 00.77.958.751.751 0 00.364-.096l3.423-1.882a.752.752 0 01.728 0l3.423 1.882a.75.75 0 00.363.096.809.809 0 00.771-.958l-.654-3.987a.841.841 0 01.225-.724l2.77-2.823a.828.828 0 00-.434-1.396l-3.827-.581a.785.785 0 01-.589-.448L8.201.456A.77.77 0 007.5 0z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 15 15" fill="none" class="starIcon__oVLE md__BECl"><path clip-rule="evenodd" d="M7.5 0a.77.77 0 00-.701.456L5.087 4.083a.785.785 0 01-.588.448l-3.827.582a.828.828 0 00-.433 1.395L3.008 9.33c.185.192.269.46.225.724l-.654 3.987a.809.809 0 00.77.958.751.751 0 00.364-.096l3.423-1.882a.752.752 0 01.728 0l3.423 1.882a.75.75 0 00.363.096.809.809 0 00.771-.958l-.654-3.987a.841.841 0 01.225-.724l2.77-2.823a.828.828 0 00-.434-1.396l-3.827-.581a.785.785 0 01-.589-.448L8.201.456A.77.77 0 007.5 0z"></path></svg></div></div><div class="ratingTitle__GKq3"><span class="title_v2__Olve title6_v2__Q3R0" role="heading" aria-level="6">All the Highlights of Athens in one day</span></div></div><div class="reviewHelpfulContainer__OVvz"><!--$--><div class="helpful__DQYk"><button aria-label="Helpful" type="button" class="helpfulIcon__fYm7"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="icon__UJ21"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M7.57 7.38L5.93 10H3.47C2.73 10 2 10.57 2 11.4v7.2c0 .83.73 1.4 1.47 1.4h2.9a555 555 0 001.18.62c.5.24 1.05.37 1.61.37h9.35c1.18 0 2.2-.9 2.35-2.08l.98-6.5v-.01l.1-.63a2.39 2.39 0 00-2.28-2.74 534.7 534.7 0 00-5.62 0h-.24v-3.4c0-.05 0-.1-.02-.14 0-.07-.01-.1-.02-.13l-.02-.16a2.1 2.1 0 00-.67-1.24 2.42 2.42 0 00-2.8-.36c-.34.19-.63.47-.84.8L7.57 7.39zm4.47-2.34A.92.92 0 0011 4.9a.8.8 0 00-.3.28c-.06.12-.97 1.57-1.86 2.99l-1.22 1.95v8.84l.6.3c.29.15.61.22.94.22h9.34c.43 0 .82-.34.87-.76.04-.35.75-5.03 1-6.64l.08-.55a.89.89 0 00-.85-1.02H19.51a63.26 63.26 0 00-1 0 2134.67 2134.67 0 00-4.47 0h-1a.75.75 0 01-.74-.75V5.7l-.02-.13V5.5a2.86 2.86 0 00-.05-.2.64.64 0 00-.2-.27zM6.12 11.5v7H3.5v-7h2.62z"></path></svg></button></div><!--/$--></div></div><div class="subtitle__RTpH">BarbaraLewis, <!-- -->Jul 2025</div><div class="reviewTextColor__mGFi"><div><span style="word-wrap:break-word">What a fantastic full day tour of Athens!
